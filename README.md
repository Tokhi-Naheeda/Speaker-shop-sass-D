# Homepage of a Speaker Shop

In this project, I recreated the homepage of a speaker shop using **Sass** and **mixins**. The goal was to design a clean, modern homepage that showcases the speakers effectively, while using Sass for better organization and styling.

### Languages Used
- **HTML** for structuring the webpage
- **CSS**, with **Sass** for more manageable styling and utilizing mixins

### Project Overview

For this project, I began by setting up the basic structure with **HTML**, making sure to adhere to the provided `index.html` boilerplate. The visual design was inspired by the mockup, and I used **Sass** to handle styles efficiently. I created a separate `styles.scss` file to keep the styles modular and maintainable. 

I compiled the Sass into a `styles.css` file using the command:

```bash
sass styles.scss styles.css --watch
```

### Intallation
1. Clone the repository:
 ```bash
git clone <repository-url>
 ```

2. Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.

3. Compile the Sass file into CSS with:
```bash
sass styles.scss styles.css --watch
```
4. Open index.html in a browser to view the page.
